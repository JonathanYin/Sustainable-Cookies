## Project Description

Our overarching goal is to create a platform which makes learning and incorporating sustainable eating into the lives of young children and their families accessible and fun. With this in mind, our project will incorporate various different forms of creative media into building a modern website with visual/interactive elements that engage the user into learning about these issues. Food is an essential part of life but many modern day eating practices are detrimental to the environment. We believe that to enact change in this fundamental human experience, it is crucial to begin sustainable habits at an early age. For example, excessive meat consumption and highly processed and packaged food are factors of what is causing the climate crisis. Methane from cow manure and the energy and waste from plastic packaging are just some of the detrimental side effects.

We know that there are food choices that can be made that have a lower carbon footprint than others. Many efforts have been made to turn the population towards these diets and options. In San Diego there are organizations that partner with communities to create and cultivate community gardens. There has been a rise in environmental vegans, where the core belief of the diet is environmental concerns rather than specism.

As humans, we are all faced with the decision of choosing what to eat multiple times each day. With the looming reality of the climate crisis, this everyday choice has now become an important way in which we can contribute to combat a dire future. We ourselves are now university students responsible for grocery shopping and cooking for ourselves, so these food choices are a huge part of our lives. As we transition into the next stages of adulthood and make independent choices, we hope to become more knowledgeable on sustainability and better address the issues of climate change in our daily lives.
