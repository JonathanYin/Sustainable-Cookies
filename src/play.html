            <h2>Companion Planting</h2>
            <p><b>Definition:</b> Growing different plant species close together so that they can benefit each other.
                How does companion planting work and why is it good?
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Companion planting makes pests and diseases hard to spread. Certain pests and diseases are easy to
                    spread on some specific plants and hard to spread on others. Planting different plant species
                    prevents pests and diseases from spreading quickly. </li>
                <li>Planting tall plants (e.g. peas and sweet corns) to create shaded regions to prevent some plants
                    (e.g. lettuce and spinach) from bolting. If a plant bolts, it cannot provide good leaves to eat.
                </li>
                <li>Planting herbs with other plants helps repel pests because leaves of herbs usually have scents that
                    insects do not like. </li>
                <li>Growing fast-growing plants together with slow-growing ones prevents the growth of weeds. Weeds
                    take in nutrients and resources that our desired plants need, and they can also spread diseases.
                </li>
                <li>Growing specific plants to attract birds and insects to help other plants grow. Some plants can
                    attract birds that eat pests, and some plants can attract bees to pollinate desired plants.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Native Plants</h2>
            <p><b>Definition:</b> Plants that occur naturally in a region where they evolved.
                Why are native plants beneficial?
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Native plants are usually healthier and stronger than other plants. </li>
                <li>Native plants require less watering, fertilizer, pesticides, etc. </li>
                <li>Native plants generally create habitat for wildlife better than other plants.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Plant Cages</h2>
            <p><b>Definition:</b> Structures surrounding plants to support and/or to protect plants.
                What are plant cages used for? There are many types of plant cages with different functions:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Some plant cages help support some plants to grow vertically instead of on the ground (e.g.
                    tomatoes).</li>
                <li>Some plant cages protect plants from being eaten by small animals like rabbits and squirrels.</li>
                <li>Some plant cages protect plants from pests.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Compost</h2>
            <p><b>Definition:</b> Compost is a mixture of ingredients used as plant fertilizer to improve the physical
                properties of soil.
                It is usually prepared by decomposing plant and food waste, recycling organic materials, and manure.
                What are the benefits of compost?
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Compost provides nutrients to plants, thus promoting higher yields of plants.</li>
                <li>Compost can substitute chemical fertilizers which are harmful to us.</li>
                <li>Composting using organic waste helps with emissions. When dealing with organic waste in landfills,
                    greenhouse gas emits, so composting reduces emissions.</li>
                <li>Compost helps maintain soil moisture. </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Drip Irrigation</h2>
            <p><b>Definition:</b> Drip irrigation is a process of managed irrigation where water is slowly brought to
                the roots of plants.
                It is usually prepared by decomposing plant and food waste, recycling organic materials, and manure.
                What are the benefits of compost?
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Drip irrigation can save water up to 70% compared with flood irrigation because extra land will also
                    be irrigated with water</li>
                <li> Drip irrigation decreases fertilizer and nutrient loss. </li>
                <li> Labor cost for drip irrigation is much lower than other irrigation methods.</li>
                <li>Drip irrigation decreases soil erosion and weed expansion.</li>
            </ol>
