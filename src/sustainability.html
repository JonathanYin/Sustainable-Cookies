                        Sustainable eating is about making food choices that are respectful to the environment while keeping our bodies healthy. Some foods are kinder to the planet than others. By choosing to eat foods that have a smaller carbon footprint, we can take action against the climate crisis and keep Earth a home for future generations.

                        Think about an orange, a yummy snack. Where did the orange come from? Let's think about two oranges, orange A is from your local farmers market versus orange B from industrial agriculture. Orange A is most likely produced in your neighborhood by people in your community. Orange B could be grown hundreds of miles away and had to be shipped a long distance to make it to your hand. Orange A has a smaller carbon footprint then Orange B because it requires less energy and less harmful emissions to be enjoyed.

                            Avoid pre-prepared fruits and vegetables which are cut and washed which require more packaging waste and energy than whole produce. Use reusable bags when grocery shopping.

                            Approach tackling food waste as a three step solution. First prevention, then recovery and finally recycling. For prevention, avoid creating food waste at the start by reducing waste at the source. To recover food, consider redistribution of extra food. Lastly, to recycle, a compost bin would be a perfect way to rid of food waste sustainably.
